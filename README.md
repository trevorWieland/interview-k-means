# interview-k-means

A simple implementation of kmeans using numpy, with basic functionality completed within an hour.

Rough log of time:
- 00:00 - 00:10: Researched the problem, searching for information about efficient numpy implementations
- 00:10 - 00:15: Set up folder structure, with modules. Created empty files, and set up requirements.txt
- 00:15 - 00:45: Wrote code implementation
- 00:45 - 00:54: Wrote a basic test function, with general debugging. Wrote this README.md file.

All core functionality as done, as well as some amount of test code.

Next steps to improve (but I'm out of time):
- Write more test cases
- Write an interface to support visualization of the clusters given some test data
- Write up a usage guide in place of this log, in the Readme.md
